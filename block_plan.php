            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Academic information and announcements at Quest University Canada are delivered through several separate channels, which prevents students from having a comprehensive overview of their current academic status, their future plans, and changes that will affect their trajectory. The decentralized approach makes gathering information needlessly difficult and its structure hinders studentsâ€™ ability to make informed decisions about their academics.</p>

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>Design an app that streamlines the academic planning process for students by centralizing academic information and offering tools that help with the planning process.</p>

            <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
            <p>The initial task was to design a solution for a problem specific to Quest. I drew on casual interviews and my own experience to discover pain points, wishes, and concerns of students living on campus. Through card sorting, I identified problems or systems that were suitable for the scope of this project (labeled with a red dot). I looked for relationships between  suitable ideas and discovered pain points around the task of selecting and registering for courses (blue boxes).
