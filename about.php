        <div class="about-body">
            <p>I’m an interaction designer with a Liberal Arts education and a deep curiosity about the way we relate to  and interact with technology.</p>

            <p>In 2012, I began my degree at a small liberal arts university in Squamish, BC. Through the block program at Quest, I learned to collaborate with others, immerse myself in complex problems, and to challenge myself to think like a _______ (scientist, lab tech, child, healthcare worker, patient, topologist, geologist, political leader, etc.). I focused on public health, policymaking, and cognitive science, and presented my undergraduate thesis about the conflicting needs of designers, stakeholders, and end users. In 2016, I began studying Interaction Design at Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design.</p>

<!--
            <p>I’m trying to do more than build nice things – I want to build experiences that are grounded in research and that suit the people who use them. As team member, I strive to be a good listener, to collaborate, and to challenge my assumptions about the way people will interact with a product or service. </p>

            <p>I draw on my broad educational background to help me better understand the context of a problem, and I actively seek out and educate myself about interesting problems. I’m currently learning about the American healthcare system, how to convince people to eat synthetic edible proteins instead of meat, and how homeless folks use technology to access essential services.</p>

            <p> As well as an interaction designer, I’m a human, and as a human I like petting all dogs, the Internet, reading anything interesting, and cooking Middle Eastern food for my friends. I also love to draw, write about what I’m learning, and pretend that I like running.</p>
